        I am interested in:
         - Unity Game and Interactive Development.
         - Minecraft Datapacks and Resource Packs.
         - Lego MindStorms EV3 
         
        I can code a little bit in Python and I'm currently learing C# for Unity, 
        I would also like to learn Java for Minecraft.

        Other interests are:
         - Making and listening to music.
         - Doing well in school.
         - Playing video games.
         - Building with Lego, especially Technic.

        I'm looking to learn from other people's projects and share different things I learned.
